## 🔍 Instructions 🔍
The repo includes several workflows designed for running Sklearn both on CPU, and on GPU with NVIDIA cuML.

### 🌄 CPU Workflow Instructions 🌄
1. Please use a WSL terminal with Anaconda installed, and enter the following commands:
```
conda create -n ml_env python=3.12
pip install scikit-learn
pip install jupyter
```
2. Clone the scikit_learn_simplified Repository to your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/MariyaSha/scikit_learn_simplified.git
```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook:
```
cd scikit_learn_simplified
jupyter lab
```
4. Type in your browser:
```
localhost:8888
```
5. Open Notebook: `ml_with_california_housing.ipynb`
